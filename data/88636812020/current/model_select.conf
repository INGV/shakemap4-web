# This file (model_select.conf) is generated automatically by the 'select'

# preserve these settings, or to modify them, copy this file to a file called

# model.conf will be used and model_select.conf will be ignored. (To avoid
# confusion, you should probably delete this comment section from your event-
# specific model.conf.)
