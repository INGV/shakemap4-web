        ShakeMap-EU is an initiative initially proposed in 2018 to: (i) provide an integrated archive of ShakeMaps at the European level built on <a href="http://www.epos-eu.org/tcs/seismology">EPOS Seismology</a> services & data products and modern community software; (ii) serve as a backup to authoritative ShakeMap implementations; (iii) deliver ShakeMaps for Euro-Mediterranean regions where no local capability is yet available. ShakeMap-EU products are accessible since mid-2020 at this website. 
        <br />

        Jointly governed by the institutions participating in the initiative, ShakeMap-EU is founded on voluntary institutional contributions and EC-funded projects.
        <br />

        ShakeMap-EU has become a reliable European seismological service that can easily and consistently integrate authoritative models and workflows. The system is based on:  (a) the latest version of <a href="https://usgs.github.io/shakemap/">ShakeMapÂ®</a>; (b) the earthquake information delivered by the <a href="https://www.emsc-csem.org/">EMSC</a>; (c) the earthquake shaking data distributed by <a href="https://orfeus-eu.org/data/strong/">ORFEUS</a>; (d) the ground motion models adopted within <a href="http://www.efehr.org/start/">EFEHR</a> for mapping seismic hazard across Europe; (e) the official ShakeMap configurations of some of the most hazardous countries in Europe. The configurations and inputs to the system are managed via a GitHub repository, which allows for automatic or manual triggering and interaction by authorized users.
        <br />

        ShakeMap-EU provides a collaboration framework and laboratory for seismological agencies to address the challenges posed by the heterogeneity of ground-shaking mapping strategies across Europe and the need to promote homogenization and best practices in this domain. ShakeMap-EU is used in research projects as the test platform for novel international collaborative research: among recent examples are the ongoing enhancements towards an evolutionary hazard information system including real-time seismicity characterisation and information on earthquake-induced phenomena.
        <br />

        ShakeMap-EU is supported by the EC projects <a href="http://www.sera-eu.org/en/home/index.html">SERA</a>, <a href="http://www.rise-eu.org/home/">RISE</a>, <a href="https://www.geo-inquire.eu/">Geo-INQUIRE</a>.
