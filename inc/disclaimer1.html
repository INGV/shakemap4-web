        This website shows the results of an ongoing activity of the EU project RISE (Horizon 2020 n. 821115).
        The technical background is summarised to link <a href="https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/QR3H4icXNYfgBrj">here</a>
        <br />

        Presently, the system replicates only the authoritative ShakeMap configurations for Italy and Switzerland whereas a general configuration for the rest of the Euro-Mediterranean region is used.
        <br />

        The website is experimental and the developers of this system do not have a mandate to backup any other national systems. Yet, additional national / regional authoritative contributions are strongly encouraged.
        <br />

        Since the project is under development and optimisation, the content of the websites and of the maps can change without any notice. That is, this is a prototype stillunder development which may change at any time without notice. In addition,  the products are not warranted to be correct, accurate, or even functional.
        <br />

        The European ShakeMaps are distributed in the hope that they will be useful, but without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
        Any industrial use of this product is discouraged at the moment.
